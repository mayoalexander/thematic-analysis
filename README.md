## Getting Started

Make sure you have NVM installed: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

```
nvm use 20
php artisan key:generate

// Start Vue.js Frontend + Serve API Backend & Queue Worker
composer run dev

Navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/analysis

```

## Overview

  🏗️ Core Architecture

  - Director Pattern with layered context management
  - ProjectContext model with 5 context layers:
    - reasoning_context - Project goals & question definitions
    - working_context - Operational settings & error logs
    - draft_context - Raw LLM outputs
    - analysis_results - Structured theme data
    - final_draft - Export-ready formatted results
  - Laravel Jobs for batch processing (one job per question)
  - OpenAI integration with gpt-4o-mini

  📊 Analysis Pipeline

  - Excel parsing with proper header support (106 participants × 6 questions)
  - Conversational text extraction (parses assistant:/user: format)
  - LLM-powered thematic analysis with structured output
  - Progress tracking and real-time status updates
  - Error handling with retry mechanisms

  🖥️ Frontend Dashboard

  - Vue.js Analysis page (/analysis) with progress tracking
  - Real-time polling for job status updates
  - Results display with themes, quotes, and participant counts
  - Export functionality (JSON, Markdown, clipboard)
  - Error display with retry buttons

  ⚡ Key Features

  - Validation layers - LLM output validation + self-review
  - Reprocessing - Retry individual questions
  - Export options - Multiple formats for results
  - Test command - php artisan analysis:test for debugging

  🚀 How to Use

  1. Set up OpenAI API

  # Add your OpenAI API key to .env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

  2. Start the queue worker

  php artisan queue:work

  3. Start the application

  composer run dev  # Starts server, queue, logs, and frontend

  4. Access the analysis dashboard

  - Visit: http://localhost/analysis
  - Click "Start Analysis" to process all 6 questions
  - Monitor progress in real-time
  - View results as they complete

  ---
  🧪 Testing

  The pipeline has been thoroughly tested:

  # Test without API calls (verify parsing & structure)
  php artisan analysis:test --skip-api

  # Test with OpenAI API (full pipeline)
  php artisan analysis:test

  Test Results:
  - ✅ Excel file parsing (106 participants)
  - ✅ Response extraction (all 6 questions)
  - ✅ Database operations
  - ✅ Context management
  - ✅ Ready for OpenAI integration
